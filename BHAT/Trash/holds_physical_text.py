intro_start_car_text = '''You run downstairs, fire up the engine of your Subaru Forester, and peel off towards SpaceZ HQ, in Balzac, Alberta

Arriving several hours later, you pull over a block down the street, where the Sun is just rising on a clear and warm Monday morning.'''

roadside_wait_here_text = '''You sit low in your vehicle until night falls. As soon as the shadows of dusk exceed their own absence you hop out, grab you backpack, and dart off into the thick bush just off the road.

Fifteen grueling minutes later you pop out of the bush, thorns and branches are caught in your clothes and hair, and you have several small cuts on your hands and face. You've arrived at the rear of the compound. Ten meters to you left is a four meter tall chain fence with a razor wire crown, broken only by a large gate secured with an inmpressive looking padlock.'''

forest_approach_gate_text = '''Kneeling down beside the pasdlock you get to work picking the lock. The pins are tight and you break two tenioners before you feel the faint scuttle of the chamber and can exhale at the lock's release. You slip in and dummy lock the pad behind you.'''

forest_approach_fence_text = '''You approach the fence at pace, launching yourself up and forward. Your hands grip the top bar, just below the razor wire, your feet hit in the flexible spot, depressing it deeply thanks to you momentum. Kicking you feet off and leveraging the rebound of the chain, you vault yourself in a twisting sprial up and over ... '''

forest_fence_have_blanket_text = '''and flip and twirl so majestically into the compound!'''

forest_fence_no_blanket_text = '''and right into the razor wire, where you struggle and bleed to death.'''

accessed_compound_text = '''You stalk the shadows until you're pressed flat against the rear of the building. A few meters to your left is a door with a camera trained on it.'''

compound_approach_door_text = '''You edge alongside the door, just out of the camera's view, and dart your hand in to test the gandle.

It's unlocked. You open it up and jolt through the camera's range as quick as possible.

Most of the light within are dimmed. There is a room just down the fhall with the light on. Approaching cautiously you note the the guard within is sleeping in his chair! You slip inside.'''

compound_keep_looking_text = '''That camera presents an unacceptable risk. You migrate around the corner of the vuilding in search of alternatives.

Running up the Northern face is a large utilities pipe, leading to the roof. This is perfect! You grapple onto the conduit and begin your ascent.'''

guard_room_have_cloner_text = '''Sneaking right up beside him, you feel your backpack bibrate slightly -- you;ve cloned his badge!

You pad back into the hallway and continue along it unobstructed until you find an elevator.. Reaching into your bag you flick a small switch and brush up against the elevator controls; the buttons light up, you're free to maneuver'''

guard_room_no_cloner_text = '''The guard has a badge on his belt that looks useful, you begin silently to lift it free.

As it comes off the belt you slowly look up to double check he hasn't woken, and a pair of very amused eyes are the last thing you see before you skull is crushed against his desk'''

elevator_push_floor_two_text = '''The elevator rises smoothly and stops at floow two. The doors open upon arrival, and you strp out into what appears to be... A gueard station... These guys look like heavies -- automatic weapons and big obscene blades strapped to various random body parts -- private military is your best guess.

"Stop! Identify yourself!"'''

elevator_push_sub_three_text = '''You exit out the elevator door directly into the aisles of a server bank. Aw hullz yuh!!

A few aisles down you encounter an access terminal.'''

lobby_am_mikael_text = '''"I am Mikael Farkus, SpaceZ CTO, you bafoons, now get back to work!"

All the buff-ass guards start laughing, then one shoots you in the leg while another zap straps your hand behind your back.

"This guy is pretty funny, eh boys!?"'''

lobby_am_john_text = '''"I'm John with Technical Security Solutions. I'm a little bit lost actually, Andrew sent me back here to get some equipment he forgot in the server room. Would you be able to help me find where I'm supposed to go please?"

The guards all start laughing, "For such big brains, you nerds sure get confused easily. Seems like every other day we're having to show you where some room or another is. Maybe you should spend some time memorizing the map at the place you spend eight hours a day, instead of color-coding your underwear and writing poems to each of the periodic elements..."

". . ."

"Ah, well, what do you do, eh?" he chuckles, "you want subfloor three in the elevator, Champ!"

"Alright, thank you very much, have a great night!"'''

mission_complete_text = '''Network Access Achieved!

You steathily make your way back out the way you came, arriving back at the Forester in about thirty minutes.

You head straight home and sit down at your desk, you plug in your super secret highly secure pass-sequence and your desktop bloomms before you with SHELLS EVERYWHERE AND STILL COMING IN!!!! There must have been a small error in the semantics of your persistance script.

You prohibit further incoming signals, and close all but one shell, which you use to exact you vengeance upon the foolish SpaceZ:
